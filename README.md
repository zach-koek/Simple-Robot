# Simple-Robot
School Project: Create a webapp that has a small moveable robot (the arrow) that you can change directions and make it go a certain amount of pixels. The robot cannot go out of the boundaries of 100 px away from the center. If the robot hits the outer boundery a warning message will appear and not let you proceed.
